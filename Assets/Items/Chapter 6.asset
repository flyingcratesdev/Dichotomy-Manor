  - Humans are so personally invested in their own fun. Whatever lets them further
    their enjoyment, well that's a deal they will take. Maybe they don't mean to
    use you. I think they do. If you knew what happened at the circus. I've worked
    there for more than a year and yet no one seems to appreciate my work.
  - ' My boss says he does, but he only says that because it makes him money. No
    one even tries to talk to me. Whenever I say something, ignored. Is fun really
    worth it when you throw others away as if they are pieces to be tossed at a moments
    notice.'
  - Well I don't fully know that. But I do. I remember when I was with my family
    back on my planet. We would take care of each other. Someone gets sick or feels
    bad, someone would immediately stop their duties and care for them. The more
    info I gather about, the more selfish and disgusting I find them to be.
