  - Today I went to what they call an "arcade". These arcades hold these boxes with
    a bunch of mechanisms that give people something fun to do. While they call the
    different boxes games, they might as well call them puzzle machines. If you twist
    the right buttons at the right times and the game is solved. These games come
    in many for factors I've found. The arcade games are a bunch of electronics and
    buttons.
  - After going to a pool hall, it seems the definition is much more wide. The games
    still are made up of a bunch of human made components, like wood fashioned into
    a wacking pole, balls with numbers made from phenolic resin. Funny how people
    derive fun from this. On a different note, the manor is done. One part ice, one
    part wood. Perfect for someone like me.
  - No more sleeping outside storing items in a random storage locker. Only problem
    now is that the place is absolutely and utterly empty. That will just have to
    gradually change. As I continue my research, this place will start to look like
    the Taj Mahal, I learned that one from a travel book. That's all for now, I got
    to get back to work soon.
