  - 'Good news. I moved out. Bad news. I''m back to sleeping outside. The appartment
    was too much to deal with, so the cold outside currently suits my needs much
    more. Thankfully, I learned about storage lockers and ended up putting all my
    items in there for the meanwhile. I also learned that with money, you can get
    anything in the world. '
  - Though I am outside, I will be inside eventually, because I hired a bunch of
    people to build me my own house, exactly how I wanted. The circus pays me "the
    big bucks", as some people might say, for being the main attraction. I want to
    know exactly why that's the case, but I won't worry too much. There are other
    matters that are more important.
  - The Puzzle Maker might be one of the greatest shows on TV, granted I haven't
    watched much TV, but it is still one of the best. My plaything theory proves
    everyday more and more to be true. I especially now see why people live to play.
    The Puzzle Maker show has moved me and given me motivation to make my own puzzles.
    Maybe I'll do one using a radio, a clock, maybe even cubes. No that last one
    kind of seems stupid, I don't think I'll do that one.
