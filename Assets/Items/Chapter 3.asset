  - Sometimes it amazes me the different activities people come up with to have fun.
    Put these shoes with razor blades on them and then walk on ice. This idea is
    so weird, I just had to try it. As someone who thrives in ice, naturally this
    activity came easy to me. I was gliding down the rink as if it were like home.
  - Speaking of home, the manor is almost finished, and I can't wait to fill it with
    all the knick nacks and goodies that I've been collecting. By the time I'm done
    my research, I will have understood the world.
