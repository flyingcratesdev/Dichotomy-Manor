  - Now that I have an actual kitchen, I can myself some proper food. Unfortunately
    when I go to the grocery store, all I find are weird objects that people end
    up eating. Now that I'm here, I guess I'll just try combining a bunch of objects
    until I find something that tastes good and like home.
  - ' Fortunately I found some pretty good combinations. Meat and tomatoes, fish
    and coffee, carrots and mushrooms. While not the greatest meals of all time,
    my taste buds could get used to human food like this. Could I? No. Maybe. I don''t
    know. '
