  - The world seems like a plaything. People come and go and work just to continue
    playing. I think the earth might be quite simple, from what I've researched this
    is my current conclusion. But research like this won't buy me a house, so I'm
    going to have settle for my circus job. The gig is quite easy honestly, it's
    basically show and then get paid.
  - Doing this has earned me a spot in an apartment. While the outside is a bit cruel,
    having a place to stay and store my things would be helpful. The main problem
    with this appartment is that I never comfortable. I wake up on the bed with sweat
    on one side of my body, not a great feeling frankly. Hopefully, at some point
    I will find a house for myself. One that will suit my needs.
